# Your BootstrapPHP Project
Basic project using Bootstrap, PHP and MySQL.

I am creating this project to teach software development using the PjBL (Project-Based Learning). In this case, a complete project will be developed by the students during the semester.

Firstly, the students will produce some prototypes with the draw.io modeling tool. These prototypes are based in the Bootstrap web development framework.

Then, some diagrams such as the UML Class and ERD (Entity-Relation Diagram) Database Diagrams will be elaborated to specify the technical solution. Next, the solution will be developped using the Bootstrap framework and PHP script language. The data will be stored in the MySQL database.

The entire life-cycle will be documented in this repository, using the project's wiki.
